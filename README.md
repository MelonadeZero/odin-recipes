Hello! If you're reading this you're looking at my very first attempt at making a website!

With this project, I will be displaying my knowledge of HTML. I will:
- Show proper use of text tags such as <p> and <h1>
- Write a boilerplate without use of auto fill
- Insert images and links into my website, using proper alt text description
- Write helpful and descriptive commit messages
